        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>In this episode, When Mrs. Wicket is ill, Mr. Bean fakes an injury in the hopes of getting himself a
            luxurious stay at the hospital like Mrs. Wicket has. Unfortunately, it is not luxurious and the nurse is
            different from whom Bean envisioned. When the nurse checks Bean with the X-ray, she is shocked when the
            nurse sees Teddy (whom Bean hides with him after learning that teddy bears are forbidden inside) in the
            image, thinking that he swallowed the whole of it, leading him to the operation room. Bean attempts to
            escape using a wheelchair with the nurse chasing him until he accidentally falls into a broken lift,
            resulting in serious injury. Despite this, he eventually gets this luxurious stay with the same nurse caring
            for him and a live band as he wished.</p>
