        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>In this episode, While watching TV with Teddy, Mr. Bean finds the remote inside the sofa, resulting in lots
            of springs coming out of his sofa; he plans to buy a new sofa, but cannot afford the cost of £300. He then
            decides to have a garage sale, but for no apparent reason all his stuff is removed by the refuse collector
            while he rescues Teddy from a spoiled little girl. Eventually, he sells a stamp for £300 to a passerby and
            finally buys the sofa. Unfortunately, Bean realises that his TV remote is still inside the old sofa and goes
            back to the antique shop where he abandoned it, but he then realised that it was sold to the driver of the
            Reliant Supervan. Bean chases the driver to retrieve his remote control but, unknown to Bean, the owner has
            already retrieved the remote control and sells it for 10p.</p>
